_A simple video streaming made with Express.js_

## What is Express?
Express is a framework for Node.js used for building server-side applications.

### Examples of things you can do with Express
* Routing e.g. when you access website_url/route_x
* Send and receive data
* Preprocess a web page (like PHP)

## What is this repository for?
This repository shows you a simple usage of Express and how to stream files through it (a video in this case).

## Usage
1. Make sure you have [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
2. With a terminal opened at this folder, run `npm install`
3. After installing, run `npm start`
4. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser and check the video stream

## I want to learn how to make it
For learning Express and video streaming, check these files out in the following order:

1. app.js
2. views/index.html
3. routes/index.js
4. routes.video.js
